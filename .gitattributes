# *.asset can be tricky. Some are text (materials, animations if serialized as text),
# but others like TerrainData or LightingData can be large and binary.
# Handle specific large .asset files or folders if needed:
# Assets/PathToLargeAssets/MyHeavy.asset filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# Or, if you know certain types of .asset files are always binary and large:
# *TerrainData.asset filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# *LightingData.asset filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# Unity specific text assets (ensure these are NOT tracked by LFS by omission or explicitly marking them as text)
